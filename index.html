	        <p>
		      I am 22 years old, I grew up in <strong>Morocco </strong> and <strong>France </strong> I'm now currently studying at <strong> ESSEC Business School </strong> in Cergy. 
	        </p>
	        <p>
		      I am fond of <strong> sports </strong>, all sort of <strong> games </strong> and I love to <strong> travel </strong> and learn new things especially physics.

	        <h2> ⚽ FOOTBALL ⚽ </h2>
	        <p>
		      Since I'm young, I love playing and watching football. My favorite team is the Morrocan team. I was very happy when <strong> Morocco represented Africa  </strong> in the 2022 world cup as it was the first african country which went to the semi-finals in history 🇲🇦🏆
      		</p>
   			 <p>
    		  Since I lived in <strong>Morocco</strong>, I also like playing beach-soccer ⚽ beach-volley 🏐 and swimming 🏊‍ On the other hand, I like to  watch <strong>MMA </strong>🥊 but it is quite complicated because of the <strong>jetlag </strong> 🕗 between USA and France.
   			 </p>
   			 <h4> Here are some of my favorite sportsmen : </h4>

    		<h2> 🍽️ FOOD 🍽️</h2>
     		<p>
    		  Passionated by international <strong>gastronomy. </strong> I like eating ramen 🍲 mexican burritos 🌮 and bosnian pita. However, the best dishes in the world are from <strong> Morocco </strong> 👩‍🍳

    		  Since I'm a <strong>student</strong>, I often eat pizzas 🍕 burgers 🍔 and pasta 🍝 .. but when I have time I like cooking better dishes like <strong> chicken curry with rice </strong>😋
